# Fractals_play
This repository holds my summer coursework for CS 510 Exploration of Fractals at Portland State.
This course involved using graphics to display fractals that we created or generated in class.
Look at [Portfolio] (/Fractals portfolio (2).pdf) for the final report of some of the work I created in class.
